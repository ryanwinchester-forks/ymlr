## [3.0.1] - 2022-09-05

### Fixed

- Wrap map keys in doouble quotes when required ([#94](https://github.com/ufirstgroup/ymlr/issues/94), [#95](https://github.com/ufirstgroup/ymlr/pull/95))
- Encode structs by turning them to lists before mapping over them

## [3.0.0] - 2022-08-07

**In this release we changed the way `DateTime` is encoded (see below). This can be a breaking change if you rely on the old date format with spaces. Because of this change, version 3.0.0 is now again compatible with Elixir 1.10**

### Changed

- use `Enum.map_join/3` indead of `Enum.map/2` and `Enum.join/2` as it's more efficient according to credo recommendations
- Change the serialization of timestamps to use the canonical (iso8601) format, i.e. before: `2022-07-31 14:48:48.000000000 Z` and now: `"2022-07-31T14:48:48Z"` ([#87](https://github.com/ufirstgroup/ymlr/issues/87), [#90](https://github.com/ufirstgroup/ymlr/pull/90))
